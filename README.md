# wang_tile_turing_machine
Course Project 3 for Theory of Computing

This project demonstrates the creation of Wang Tiles and their relation to Turing Machines. I wrote two programs to demonstrate how Wang Tiles can be used to make computer graphics and how Turing Machines can be converted to Wang Tiles. These programs are written in Python3 and easily viewed in the Jupyter iPython notebook.
